Programul Caesar Cipher

Acest program scris in python implementeaza cei mai simplu algoritmi de encryptie si decriptie cunoscut, care este Caesar Cipher, in care fiecare litera se muta de la numarul specificat de locuri. It can both be message encrypted and a message decryption and allows the user of the program to go into a loop until he decides not to.

Features

Encrypt Messages: It performs letter shifting of desired forward number and coverts the text into ciphertext.

Decrypt Messages: Performing multi letter shifts in reverse to convert the ciphertext back to the plaintext.

Handles Non-Alphabetic Characters: This feature maintains spaces and any numbers and special characters.

Interactive Menu: Has a simplistic menu for the user which includes encrypting, decrypting or just logging out.

How It Works

The user will decide if they want to encrypt or decrypt the message.

The user types in a message and an integer for the shift.

The application follows the steps of the Caesar Cipher algorithm and shows the output.

The application works in a loop until the user decides to log out.
